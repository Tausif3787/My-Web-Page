						<td><p>In oop2 i have done Human Resource Management System. In this project i did insert,delete,update and searching. There is an admin in my project who can 
						controll all the task. A Human Resource Management System or HRIS (Human Resource Information System) is a form of HR software that combines a number of
						systems and processes to ensure the easy management of human resources, business processes and data. Human Resources Software is used by businesses to combine
						a number of necessary HR functions, such as storing employee data,payrolls managing payrolls, recruitment processes, benefits administration and keeping track
						of attendance records. It ensures everyday Human Resources processes are manageable and easy to access.[1]It merges human resources as a discipline and, in 
						particular, its basic HR activities and processes with the information technology field, whereas the programming of data processing systems evolved into
						standardized routines and packages of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software. On the whole, these ERP systems have their origin from software that 
						integrates information from different applications into one universal database. The linkage of its financial and human resource modules through one database
						is the most important distinction to the individually and proprietarily developed predecessors, which makes this software application both rigid and flexible.
						Human Resource Information Systems provide a means of acquiring, storing, analyzing and distributing information to various stakeholders.HRIS enable 
						improvement in traditional processes and enhance strategic decision-making.Here i am giving you the linkdin link of my project</p>
