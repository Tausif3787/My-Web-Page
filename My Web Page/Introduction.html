						<td><p>Hello everyone,I am Tausif Ahmed.I am a student of American International University Bangladesh. I Am doing bsc in cse. To tell me about myself,i 
						must say i am a quite person.I am not free with unknown person. I get some time to observe new person when i met them. I am kind an introvert.<br><br>
						I love travelling. My dream is one day i will travel whole the world. I love japan country. I wish i could visit japan city but one day i will sure visit 
						this country.Japan is a fascinating country of economic and business prowess, rich culture, technical wizardry, spatial conundrums and contradictions. 
						Japan held onto the title of the world’s second largest economy for more than 40 years from 1968 to 2010. Tokyo, Japan’s capital city, is the world’s 
						largest metropolitan area, with a population of 32.5 million people. Despite having an area slightly bigger than Germany and smaller than California, 
						Japan is the world’s tenth largest country by population, with 127.3 million people.<br><br>
						I Also love to listen music.My favourite singer is Ed-Shareen and fav band is west-life. I also like arijit singh's music.Hokkaido, the second largest 
						Japanese island and northernmost prefecture, accounts for nearly a quarter of Japan’s arable land.  Hokkaido leads Japan’s other 46 prefectures in the 
						production of seafood and a host of agricultural products, including soybeans (the key ingredient for tofu and all things miso), wheat, corn, beef and 
						raw milk.  Sapporo, Hokkaido’s capital and largest city, hosts the annual Sapporo Snow Festival, which regularly draws more than 2 million visitors to 
						the spectacular exhibition of some 400 snow and ice sculptures.</p>

				<h3>Shylet Tour</h3>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td><p>Recently i visited shylet.Friendly Sylhet is a divisional capital with a pronounced small-town feel, its congested streets and bustling roadside
						markets chipping in with requisite measures of sights, sounds and smells. The town, however, also gives off a strong underlying sense of economic 
						prosperity. The majority of British Bangladeshis hail from here, and those with stronger ties to the homeland continue to visit their families regularly
						and pour money back into the local economy. This has helped create a city that is more modern than other comparable urban centres in Bangladesh. 
						For tourists, it also means the availability of better hotels and restaurants, easier access to creature comforts and a disproportionately large local
						population that speaks good English.Nestled in the picturesque Surma Valley amidst scenic tea plantations and lush green tropical forests, greater Sylhet
						is a prime attraction for all tourists visiting Bangladesh. Sylhet has developed due to remittances from the expatriates living in Britain and America.
						Laying between the Khasia and the Jaintia hills on the north, and the Tripura hills on the south, Sylhet breaks the monotony of the flatness of this land 
						by a multitude of terraced tea gardens, rolling countryside and the exotic flora and fauna. Here the thick tropical forests abound with many species of
						wildlife, spread their aroma around the typical hearth and homes of the Monipuri Tribal maidens famous for their dance. The town, however, also gives off 
						a strong underlying sense of economic prosperity. The majority of British Bangladeshis hail from here, and those with stronger ties to the homeland continue
						to visit their families regularly and pour money back into the local economy..</p>

						<td><p>Bangladesh, a gift of God, is abounding of natural sceneries and historical places. Without observing it everybody misses a lot of blessings which 
						are supernatural and human created. There are many islands, rivers, green fields, animals, historical places, buildings, monuments and unbelievable things 
						and elements which alwaysl charm us all most. So if you do not visit this natural gifted country, you will miss a bound of elements. The scenery of the 
						country is far fetched.  The people of this country are traditional, religious, co-operative, friendly and simple. Here we always find an excellent 
						relationship among the family members, races and nations. Most of the people like to travel and wander. Several times they are seen to visit in different
						historical places and different beaches. The country has many natural sea beaches, among them Cox’s Bazar is worldwide familiar and popular.
